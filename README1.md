Problem Statement- Microlenders and fintech institutions operate in high-risk lending environments, particularly when serving underbanked populations. Traditional credit scoring approaches often fail to capture alternative behavioral and financial signals, resulting in elevated default rates or exclusion of creditworthy borrowers.This project develops a machine learning–based credit risk scoring system to predict loan default probability using customer demographic, financial, and behavioral data.

Objectives
-- Build a robust credit risk prediction model
-- Address class imbalance and real-world data constraints
-- Apply explainable AI techniques to support transparent decision-making
-- Evaluate models using business-relevant risk metrics

Business Value
-- Improved loan approval accuracy
-- Reduced default rates
-- Better risk-adjusted returns
-- Support for responsible financial inclusion

Scope
-- Binary classification (default vs non-default)
-- Structured tabular data
-- Model explainability and governance considerations
-- Prototype-level deployment readiness
